# Hey, I'm [2bap]! 👋

I’m a **17-year-old developer** with a passion for coding and bringing creative ideas to life through tech. I’ve been diving deep into web development and Python for around 6 months. I have successfully rebuilt 2PACALYPSE and made it an actual tool that hits around **400Gbps** with the gudp method **(there is 24 methods)** and I will **NOT** be giving it out as of now.

### 🔧 **What I’m Working On**
- **Web Development**: Currently building dynamic websites with features such as implementing a fully custom API all self coded that allows users to login/signup and have a dashboard for them to customize shit to their liking.
- **Python Projects**: I currently run a discord bot with 50 commands (Music, Fun, Security) and even fully automated security features that bots such as Security, Carlbot, and MEE6 normally lock behind a paywall (AutoMod, Anti-Raid, Anti-Spam) entirely free of cost! I also have a few other tools that I use occasionally (Spotify Artist image downloader and option to download all album images, autoclicker that can click 2000cps, domain pinger and nping, VRChat OSC)

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript  
- **Current Focus**: Working on biolink pages, and python projects I might publish here if I think they are worth it enough to publish.

### 🚀 **Looking Ahead**
- Continue improving my skills by diving into more advanced coding challenges.
- Explore new design ideas that blend creativity with functionality.
