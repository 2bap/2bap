### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a developer who’s been diving deep into **Web Development** and **Python** for the past six months, constantly exploring, learning, and creating. My journey in tech is fueled by passion, curiosity, and a love for bringing creative ideas to life.

### 🌐 My Projects

- **🚀 2PACALYPSE Rebuild**: Completely upgraded the tool with a powerful `gudp` method that reaches up to 400Gbps 🚀 (47 methods in total). Currently keeping this project private.

- **🌍 Dynamic Websites**: I’m building custom websites with fully self-coded APIs for user authentication, profiles, and customization dashboards — everything a user needs to make it their own.

- **🤖 Discord Bot (54 Commands)**: A multifunctional bot with **Music, Fun, and Security** commands. Features like **AutoMod, Anti-Raid, and Anti-Spam** come entirely free of charge, bypassing the usual paid features of bots like MEE6 and Carlbot.
